# 📘 PyMatrix Journey 

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey** where I practice Python through simple yet powerful **matrix-based problems**.  
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks focusing on hands-on learning, logic building, and improving coding confidence.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

### **001_add_two_matrices.ipynb**
- Adds two matrices
- Handles different sizes
- Shows step-by-step logic

### **002_transpose_a_matrix.ipynb**
- Computes the transpose of a matrix
- Uses loops and/or list comprehension
- Beginner-friendly approach

### **003_multiply_two_matrices.ipynb**
- Multiplies two matrices
- Includes validation (rows vs columns)
- Demonstrates nested loops clearly
