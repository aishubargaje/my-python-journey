# Day 01 - Hello World 🚀

## 📌 Description
This is my first Python program as part of my Python Improvement Journey.  
The classic **Hello World** program is often the first step in learning any programming language.  

It helps to:  
- Understand how to write and run a basic Python script  
- Get familiar with the `print()` function  
- Build confidence to start coding
